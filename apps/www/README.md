This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## User Preferences

This application includes support for user preferences, including theme settings (light/dark/system), 
language preferences, and notification settings. These settings are stored in the database and 
applied across the entire application.

### Features

- Theme preferences (light, dark, system)
- Language preferences
- Email notification settings
- User data export
- Account deletion

### Implementation

The user preferences system utilizes:

1. A `UserPreference` model in the Prisma schema
2. API endpoints for managing preferences
3. Context-based access to preferences via `useUser()` hook
4. Automatic theme application via the `useThemePreference()` hook

### Running the Migration

To add user preferences support to your database:

```bash
# Run the migration script
./scripts/add-user-preferences.sh
```
